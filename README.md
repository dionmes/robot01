# Robot01

A ripped Robosapien LLM powered robot.  

- **Hardware**   
- **Firmware**  
	Two ESP32 boards, one for body movement, display, speaker and sensors. One for the camera and mic (sense).
	- Main
	- Sense

- **Web interface & AI models**
	Implemented on a Nvidia AGX Xaver development board. All models run locally (tts, stt, llm)


I am not a hardware guy, so the Hardware is really a mess. It just a bunch of sensors and other peripherals hooked up to two esp32 boards. Use it for inspiration not implementation.
